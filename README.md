# BoF-Script
Python3 script to assist in the process of developing, single-stage, stack-based buffer overflow


## NOT INTENDED FOR ANY MALICIOUS ACTIVITY
This script is intended to walk athrough a process of developing a BoF as a series of
organized steps:
1. Send a filler to initiate a crash
2. Send a pattern generated by msfvenom to mark the EIP location
3. Find the EIP offset and enter it into the definitions object
4. Find how much space there is after the EIP
5. Helps look for bad characters
6. Before running step 6, use the Immunity debugger to find the "FFE4 jmp esp":
   a. !mona modules
   b. !mona find -s "\xff\xe4" -m [dll library name]
7. Generates the shell, prints it out. If you like it, copy into the MyDefinitions.py file
8. Start the listener, send the payload and catch the shell.
